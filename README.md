# HiCT
Combines all HiCT-related repositories as submodules

## How to test-drive HiCT

Thanks to the GitHub Actions and Container Registry, you can try out HiCT even without cloning this repository by using autogenerated Docker images.
If you do not have Docker installed, [check this](https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/ubuntu/) or use a single-liner: 
```
curl -fsSL get.docker.com -o get-docker.sh && sh get-docker.sh
```

Assuming you now have Docker installed, launch this command in your terminal:
```
docker run \
  -p 8080:80/tcp \
  -p 5000:5000/tcp \
  --mount type=bind,source=/path/to/the/data,target=/app/data \
  ghcr.io/ctlab/hict-full:latest
```

* You have to change `/path/to/the/data` to actual absolute path where you store your Coolers, AGPs, FASTAs and `.hict.hdf5` files (you can store all these files in the subdirectories of that folder).
* You can change port `8080` to any other, that's the port where your WebUI will be available from host (whereas `80` is the port inside docker container and should not be changed). 
* Port `5000` is used for communications between WebUI and Server, you can change that but remember to set new port in WebUI (Connection Settings at the top of the page).

After running this command, open your web browser and navigate to the `http://localhost:8080`, WebUI should open.

## How to properly clone this repository

All HiCT-related repositories are added as git submodules, so in order to properly initialize them, you need to add `--recurse-submodules` option to your command like: `git clone --recurse-submodules https://github.com/ctlab/HiCT.git` (via HTTPS) or `git clone --recurse-submodules git@github.com:ctlab/HiCT.git` (via SSH).

If you have already cloned repository without submodules, run `git submodule update --init --recursive` at the root of this cloned repository.
