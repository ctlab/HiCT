# HiCT
Combines all HiCT-related repositories as submodules
---

## How to test-drive HiCT

Thanks to the GitHub Actions and Container Registry, you can try out HiCT even without cloning this repository by using autogenerated Docker images (assuming you have Docker installed). 
Just use the command like: `docker run -p 8080:80/tcp -p 5000:5000/tcp --mount type=bind,source=/path/to/the/data,target=/app/data ghcr.io/ctlab/hict-full:latest`. Just remember to change `/path/to/the/data` to actual absolute path where you store your Coolers, AGPs, FASTAs and `.hict.hdf5` files (you can store all these files in the subdirectories of that folder).

## How to properly clone this repository

All HiCT-related repositories are added as git submodules, so in order to properly initialize them, you need to add `--recurse-submodules` option to your command like: `git clone --recurse-submodules https://github.com/ctlab/HiCT.git` (via HTTPS) or `git clone --recurse-submodules git@github.com:ctlab/HiCT.git` (via SSH).

If you have already cloned repository without submodules, run `git submodule update --init --recursive` at the root of this cloned repository.
